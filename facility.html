              The following Service Terms cover your responsibilities when using our mobile app ("App") or service (as defined here), or any content created or provided by or through the App or service, or when you sell products on the App and create User Contributed Content (as defined here). Also check out our Privacy Policy, which is part of these Terms and explains how we handle your personal information.
              Read these Service Terms carefully before using the App or service. By accessing the App or using any part of the service, you agree to these terms. If not, don't access the App or use the service. Nothing in this agreement gives rights or benefits to third parties.
