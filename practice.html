          <p class="phase-content">• - Access and Updates. We endeavor to enable you to access and manage the personal information we hold about you.

You can access and update your account information directly in the app by going to the app's Settings page. If you need to access, update, or delete any other personal information we might have, you can submit a request here. Since your privacy is significant to us, we may ask you to confirm your identity or provide additional details before granting you access or allowing you to update your personal information. You can also remove our service from your mobile device or initiate account deletion.</p>
          <p class="phase-content">• - Revoking Permissions. If you change your mind about our ongoing ability to collect information from certain sources you've previously consented to, like your phonebook, camera, photos, or location services, you can revoke your consent by adjusting the settings on your device if your device offers those options. Of course, if you do this, certain services may lose full functionality.</p>
          <p class="phase-content">• - Erasure. You have the right to request the removal of your personal information under certain circumstances. Note that your right to erasure may be limited if the data is needed for compliance with a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.</p>
