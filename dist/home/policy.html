          <p class="phase-title">Privacy Policy</p>
          <p class="phase-content">Bene is a mobile application for live video chatting. Through it, you can encounter captivating and wonderful people from across the globe, have enjoyable conversations, and make new friends on our platform. The personal information of our users is a crucial component of our business. Hence, please peruse this Privacy Policy meticulously. By utilizing or accessing our App or Service, you consent to the privacy policies delineated below.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="phase">
          <p class="phase-title">What Is Encompassed by this Privacy Policy?</p>
          <p class="phase-content">This Privacy Policy pertains to the handling of Personal Information by Bene when you are employing the App and the Service. This policy is not applicable to the practices of third parties that are not possessed or controlled by Bene, including but not limited to third-party services that you access via Bene, the App or the Service, or to individuals that are not hired or managed by Bene. Since our Service integrates with third-party sites like Facebook and other sites and social networks, we presume that you are already acquainted with the privacy policies of those other sites and networks when using our App and/or Service and when you permit us to interact with these sites and networks on your behalf.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="phase">
          <p class="phase-title">The Service</p>
          <p class="phase-content">The principal function of Bene is a real-time video chat mobile application, enabling users to meet intriguing and nice people from all over the world, have pleasant chats, and make new friends on our platform. It pairs individuals (“Users”) based on compatibility and other factors and permits them to chat and communicate online through diverse means, including text, video, linking and accessing third-party social network platforms such as, but not limited to, Snapchat (collectively, the “Service”). In accordance with relevant international regulations, Bene will not provide the Service in the following countries or territories: Cuba Iran Syria North Korea Crimea The so-called Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) and Luhansk People's Republic (LNR) Russia Belarus</p>
        </div>
        <div class="phase">
          <p class="phase-title">The Information We Collect</p>
          <p class="phase-content">There are three primary methods through which we gather information: • - Information you voluntarily offer to us • - Information we acquire when you use our services • - Information we obtain from third parties Here is a more detailed account of each of these types.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="phase">
          <p class="phase-title">Information You Voluntarily Provide to Us</p>
          <p class="phase-content">By visiting and interacting with Bene, its App and/or its Service, you furnish us with Personal Information, which may consist of, but is not limited to, the following: • - Personally Identifiable Information: This could include, without limitation, the information provided when you register to utilize the App and/or the Service, such as your name, profile picture, date of birth, phone number, phone book content, address, email address, occupation, employer, gender, age, birthday, Facebook account details and friend list, and/or other social network usernames and 'likes' and preferences, friend lists and the number of friends you have through social networks, messages to other users of the App and the Service, usage details regarding your utilization of the Service, the profile picture that you upload via the App or the Service, and browser information. • - The information you opt to provide as mentioned above may be shared with your contacts on our service. You have complete control over your profile information and can access and modify it at any time. Additionally, if you register to our service using your Facebook account (e.g. Facebook Connect), we may store your Facebook ID and corresponding token on our servers and, if you grant us your explicit consent, we will have access to and may collect certain information that you make accessible on Facebook (for instance, your first and last names, email address, profile picture, your friend lists and birthdays). Your Profile is accessible to other users of the Service who are connected to you on our service. Moreover, unless you choose to opt-out (which you can do at any time in the settings of our application), your Profile can be discovered by other users. You can decide to “block” any user on our platform to prevent unauthorized access to your Personal Information. • - You may also choose to share your mobile device’s Contacts list with us (including names, numbers, emails, Facebook ID, Apple ID, etc) and we will store it on our servers to assist you in enhancing our service, for example, connecting with friends on our service. If you do not wish us to store this information, you can opt-out through your account settings or notify us via email. If you do this, we will not be able to offer certain features of our service. Naturally, you will also provide us with any information you send through the services. It should be kept in mind that the users to whom you send texts, images, and any other content can always save that content or copy it outside the app. So, the same common sense applicable to the Internet in general also applies to Bene: Don’t send messages or share content that you would not want someone to save or share. It probably goes without saying, but we will state it anyway: When you contact Bene Support or communicate with us in any other way, we will collect whatever information you offer voluntarily.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="phase">
          <p class="phase-title">Information We Obtain When You Use Our Services</p>
          <p class="phase-content">When you utilize our services, we gather data about which services you have used and how. For example, we might know that you employed a certain filter in the app and how often. Here's a more detailed account of the information we collect when you use our services:</p>
          <p class="phase-content">Usage Information. We collect details regarding your activities through our services. This might include:</p>
          <p class="phase-content">How you interact with the services, like which filters you view or how often you use a feature.</p>
          <p class="phase-content">How you communicate with other Bene users, such as their names, the time and date of your communications, the number of messages exchanged, which friends you communicate with most, and your interactions with messages (like when you open a message or take a screenshot). If you share text messages, photos, screenshots, videos, or other communications on our service, they may be stored on our servers. Also, if you share these with others, we might not be able to remove them or make them unavailable to those you shared with. Sharing such information is your choice, but be aware that you might lose control over its use and it could become public. We aren't responsible for any misuse of the shared information.</p>
          <p class="phase-content">Device Information. We collect device-specific data, like the hardware model, operating system version, advertising identifier, unique application identifiers, unique device identifiers, browser type, language, wireless network, non-direct display of content moderation, and mobile network information (including the mobile phone number).</p>
          <p class="phase-content">User-generated content like photos, screenshots, comments, and other materials you create on the service might also be collected. Your photos and videos could be captured by other users, and these contents can be stored and used by us or third-party services (e.g. Facebook) for content moderation and community safety monitoring. You can adjust third-party sharing options in our product settings or contact us directly.</p>
          <p class="phase-content">Device Phonebook. Since Bene is about communicating with friends, we may – with your consent – collect information from your device's phonebook.</p>
          <p class="phase-content">Location Information. When you use our services, we might collect your location data. With your consent, we might also collect precise location details using methods like GPS, wireless networks, cell towers, Wi-Fi access points, and other sensors such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compasses.</p>
          <p class="phase-content">Information Collected by Cookies and Other Technologies. Like many online services and mobile apps, we might use cookies and other technologies like web beacons, web storage, and unique advertising identifiers to collect information about your activities, browser, and device. We might also use these when you interact with services we offer through partners. Most web browsers accept cookies by default. You can usually remove or reject them through your browser or device settings. Remember, doing so could affect our services' availability and functionality. For more about our use of cookies and your choices, check our Cookie Statement.

          <p class="phase-title">Information Collected by Us from Third Parties</p>
          <p class="phase-content"> We may gather information that other users provide about you when they utilize our services. For example, if another user allows us to collect information from their device phonebook – and you are one of that user’s contacts – we could combine the information we obtain from that user’s phonebook with other information we have amassed about you. We may also acquire information from other companies that are owned or managed by us, or any other third-party sources, and integrate that with the information we collect through our services.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="phase">

          <p class="phase-title">How We Share Information</p>

Moreover, other users can follow you on the App, and your followers can see, for example, the content you uploaded. People reading this info may use or disclose it beyond our control and without your knowledge. So, be cautious about including private details. Your information may also be stored and processed in any country where we offer service due to server facilities and third-party service teams. By using our service, you consent to such transfers. If you don't agree with this Privacy Policy, don't use our service. Community safety is our priority and some of the above user information is mandatory for a safe community.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="phase">
          <p class="phase-title">Information You Decide to Share with Third Parties</p>
          <p class="phase-content">The services might additionally incorporate third-party links and search outcomes, include third-party integrations, or be a co-branded or third-party-branded service jointly provided with or by another firm. By accessing such links, employing the third-party integration, or making use of a co-branded or third-party-branded service, you could furnish information (including personal details) directly to the third party, us, or both. You recognize and agree that we are not liable for how those third parties gather or utilize your information. To the extent that you utilize a profile accessible to others on our Service, you are solely accountable for its content and accuracy at all times. As is common, we encourage you to peruse the privacy policies of every third-party website or service you visit or utilize, including those third parties you interact with via our services.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="phase">
          <p class="phase-title">How Long We Keep Your Content</p>
          <p class="phase-content">Ultimately, and this is crucial, you should be aware that users viewing the content you offer can always save it through diverse means: screenshots, in-app functionality, or any other image-capturing technology. It is also feasible, as with any digital data, that someone might have the ability to access messages through forensic methods or find them in a device's temporary storage. If any deletion of user information of our App takes place, we cannot assure that the deletion will occur within a definite time. Moreover, we may also retain certain information in backup for a limited duration or as mandated by law.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="phase">
          <p class="phase-title">How We Protect Your Information</p>
          <p class="phase-content">Protecting user privacy and personal data holds paramount significance for us. We handle your personal information to enhance and enforce our security measures, combat spam, malware, malicious activities, or security risks, and to monitor and verify your identity to prevent unauthorized users from accessing your account with us. Access to any user information is restricted to our employees, contractors, agents, and third-party service providers ONLY who require knowing the information to provide, operate, develop, maintain, support, and optimize our service experience and security. We utilize password protection, access logs, and system monitoring to safeguard the confidentiality and security of all user information. Due to the intrinsic nature of the internet and related technology, we do not guarantee the protection of information under our control against loss, misuse, or modification.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="phase">
          <p class="phase-title">Control over Your Information</p>
          <p class="phase-content">Our aim is to provide you with control over your information, and therefore we offer you the following tools:</p>
          <p class="phase-content">• - Access and Updates. We endeavor to allow you to access and manage the personal information we have about you. However, there are constraints to the requests we can fulfill. We may decline a request for several reasons, for example, if the request poses a threat to the privacy of other users or is unlawful. You can access and update your account information directly in the app by visiting the Settings page of the app. If you need to access, update, or delete any other personal information we might possess, you can submit a request here. Because your privacy is of importance to us, we might ask you to confirm your identity or provide additional particulars before we allow you to access or update your personal information. You can also remove our service from your mobile device or proceed with account deletion.</p>
          <p class="phase-content">• - Revoking Permissions. If you change your mind about our continuous ability to collect information from certain sources you previously consented to, such as your phonebook, camera, photos, or location services, you can simply withdraw your consent by adjusting the settings on your device if your device offers those options. Naturally, if you do this, certain services might lose their full functionality.</p>
          <p class="phase-content">• - Erasure. You have the right to request the elimination of your personal information under certain circumstances. Please note that your right to erasure might be limited if the data are necessary for compliance with a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</p>
          <p class="phase-content">• - Restriction on Processing: You have the right to object to and request restrictions on the processing of your personal information in specific cases.</p>
          <p class="phase-content">• - Objection: You have the right to object, based on your specific situation, at any time, to the processing of your personal information. Bene shall no longer process the personal information unless Bene demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims;</p>
        </div>
        <div class="phase">
          <p class="phase-title">Data Removal</p>
          <p class="phase-content">You have the freedom to remove your data whenever you feel like it. If you ask us to erase your account, we will make commercially sensible efforts to eliminate your data from our servers. This is subject to any legal or other obligation to keep certain records of your personally identifiable data. It's important to note that removing your personally identifiable data from our database might prevent us from offering you the Service. If you need to get rid of any data or personal information we might have, you can simply click “Me - Settings - Delete account”. But we might ask you to confirm your identity or provide extra information before allowing you to delete your personal details.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="phase">
          <p class="phase-title">Analytics and Advertising Services Provided by Others</p>
          <p class="phase-content">We might allow other enterprises to apply cookies, web beacons, and similar tracking technologies on the services. These companies could gather information about how you use the services and other websites and online services over a period of time and across various services. This data could be used for multiple purposes, like analyzing and tracking information, determining the popularity of specific content, and having a deeper understanding of your online actions. Additionally, some companies might utilize the information they collect on our services to provide targeted advertisements on behalf of us or other firms, including on third-party websites and applications. Currently, Bene doesn't respond to do-not-track signals that could be sent from your device. If we do this in the future, we'll give information about that practice in an updated version of this privacy policy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="phase">
          <p class="phase-title">Children</p>
          <p class="phase-content">Our services are not intended for – and we don't direct them to – anyone under 18. That's the reason we don't deliberately collect personal information from individuals under 18.</p>

          <p class="phase-title">Revisions to the Privacy Policy</p>
          <p class="phase-content">We may make changes to this privacy policy from time to time. However, when we do so, we will inform you in one way or another. Sometimes, we'll let you know by changing the date at the top of the privacy policy accessible on our website and mobile application. At other times, we might offer you additional notification (such as adding a statement to the homepages of our websites or giving you an in-app notice).</p>
