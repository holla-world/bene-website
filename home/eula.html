              contract or tort or otherwise, will not exceed $500.

              For Disputes where the total award sought is less than $5,000 and excluding claims for injunctive or other

              through an established ADR Provider. The arbitration shall follow the provider's rules, except where they
              conflict with this Agreement. The requesting party proposes an ADR Provider, and the other party shouldn't
              unreasonably withhold consent. The arbitration can be by phone, online, or written submissions. It's in
              English, with no personal appearance unless agreed. The award can be entered in any competent court. Each
              party bears its own costs and shares the ADR Provider's fees equally.

              Other Disputes shall be referred to and determined by arbitration under the JAMS Commercial Arbitration

              provided by the Administrator. If the parties can't agree within 10 days of receiving the list, the
              Administrator selects. Proceedings and evidence are in English. Each party bears its own costs and shares
              the Administrator and Arbitrator's fees. The Arbitrator can determine the prevailing party and award
              reimbursement. The Arbitrator issues a written award and decision, and has the authority to grant
              equitable relief. The award is final and binding, except as permitted by law. However, Bene can go to
              court for intellectual property protection or injunctive relief.
