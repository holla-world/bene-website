              a dispute is not resolved within 45 days from a party's notice of a dispute, then disputes can be
              submitted to arbitration. Smaller disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than five

              at the option of the party seeking relief. Larger disputes shall be referred to and ultimately determined
              by arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Commercial Arbitration Rules. Each party bears its own costs

              grant equitable relief. Judgment on the award can be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. BENE
              may directly turn to any court of competent jurisdiction to seek protection or enforcement of its
              intellectual property rights and/or to obtain injunctive relief or other equitable relief.
