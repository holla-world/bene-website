              Welcome to Bene! We have framed these Terms of Service (which we simply refer to as "Terms") to make sure
              you are familiar with the rules governing our connection with you. Despite our efforts to reduce legal
              jargon in the Terms, there are still parts that might resemble a conventional contract. Please study them
              thoroughly. By availing the Services, you consent to the Terms. Naturally, if you are not in agreement
              with them, then avoid using the Services. The following Terms of Service describe your duties when making
              use of our mobile application (“App”) or Service (as defined here), or any of the information, text,
              graphics, videos, or other files, materials, data or content of any kind created or provided by or through
              the App or the Service or through your capacity to sell products on the App and produce User Contributed
              Content (as defined here). Kindly also peruse our Privacy Policy, which is a component of these Terms of
              Service and which details our methods for dealing with any personal information you might offer to us.
              Please read these Terms of Service carefully before using the App or the Service. By accessing the App or
              using any portion of the Service, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions. If you do not
              consent to all these terms and conditions, then you may not access the App or utilize the Service. Nothing
              in this Agreement should be interpreted as granting any rights or benefits to third parties. ARBITRATION
              NOTE: WE WISH TO INFORM YOU IN ADVANCE THAT THESE TERMS ENCOMPASS AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE A LITTLE FURTHER
              BELOW. EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES MENTIONED IN THAT ARBITRATION CLAUSE, YOU AND Bene AGREE THAT
              DISPUTES BETWEEN US WILL BE SOLVED THROUGH OBLIGATORY BINDING ARBITRATION, AND YOU AND Bene FORFEIT ANY
              RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.

            <p class="paragraph-content">
              Persons under 18 are prohibited from creating an account or making use of the Services. We might provide
              additional Services with supplementary conditions that might demand you to be of a greater age to employ
              them. Hence, please peruse all terms with caution. -You can establish a legally binding contract with
              Bene; -You will comply with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws,
              rules, and regulations. If you are using the Services on behalf of a business or some other entity, you
              affirm that you are authorized to grant all licenses stipulated in these Terms and to consent to these
              Terms on behalf of the business or entity. If you are using the Services on behalf of an entity of the
              United States Government or Chinese Government, you concur with the Amendment to Bene Terms of Service for
              the United States Government and Chinese Government Users. No one under 18 is allowed to create an account
              or utilize the Services. You hereby assure that you are at least 18 years of age. In the event that the
              information you furnish in this regard is inaccurate, Bene will not be held accountable as it is unable to
              verify the age of its users. If you are under 18 years old, do not endeavor to register for the App or the
              Service. If you are under the age of 18, you may use the Service only with the consent of your parent or
              guardian. Additionally, you should review these terms with your parent or guardian to ensure that you and
              your parent or guardian comprehend and agree with these terms.

              Bene grants you a personal, global, royalty-free, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable, and
              non-sub-licensable license to access and utilize the Services. This license is solely intended to enable
              you to make use of and enjoy the benefits of the Service in a manner consistent with these Terms and our
              usage policies. Any software we supply to you may automatically download and install enhancements,

              A significant number of our Services enable you to create, upload, etc. content. You retain initial
              ownership, but grant us a license. The license extent varies. For all Services, you give Bene a global,
              etc. license for specific purposes. For Local and crowd-sourced Services, the license is more extensive,
              including perpetual rights. You also grant rights to your name, likeness, etc. You won't be compensated.
              We may review and delete your content. You're responsible for it. The Services may have ads. You consent
              to ads. We welcome user communications. If you offer feedback/suggestions, we can use them without

              A significant quantity of the content on our Services is created by users, publishers, and other third
              parties. Whether such content is publicly posted or privately sent, it is the sole accountability of the
              person or organization that submitted it. Although Bene reserves the right to review all the content that
              appears on the Services and to eliminate any content that violates these Terms, we do not necessarily
              review all of it. Therefore, we cannot – and do not – be held accountable for any content that others
              provide through the Services. Through these Terms, we make it evident that we do not desire the Services
              to be utilized inappropriately. But since we do not review all the content, we cannot guarantee that the
              content on the Services will always conform to our Terms. We do not endorse, support, represent or
              guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any content contributed by users or endorse any of
              the opinions expressed therein. You agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or
              remedies you have or may have against us in this respect. You acknowledge that any reliance on User
              Contributed Content of any Bene user will be at your own risk.

                or develop any third-party applications that interact with the Services or other users' content or

                We may provide various friendship-making Services that you can purchase and utilize through the
                Services. You do not own these Services; rather, you purchase an adequate number of app gems to use
                them. Before you finalize a purchase, you will always be shown the price for the Services. However, Bene
                does not handle payments or payment processing for any purchases; these are managed by third-party
                payment providers or service providers (such as Apple's iOS Store and Google's Google Play Store, among
                others). Some third-party service providers might charge you sales tax, depending on your location.
                Please review the relevant terms of the third-party service provider for detailed information. Subject
                to any applicable additional terms and conditions, all purchases are final and non-refundable. And
                because our performance begins as soon as you click buy and we provide you with immediate access to your
                purchase, you waive any right you might have under EU or other local law to cancel your purchase once it
                is completed or to obtain a refund. BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU AGREE THAT Bene IS NOT OBLIGED TO
                PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON. Some of the Virtual Products we offer are for single use only, while
                others are for repeated use. But please note that "repeated" does not mean "forever". We may change,
                modify, or eliminate Virtual Products at any time, with or without notice. You agree that we will not be
                liable to you or any third party if we do so. If we suspend or terminate your account, you will lose any
                products you purchased through the services. If your Bene account remains inactive for 3 consecutive
                months, all of your free virtual Coins may be frozen. To unfreeze such virtual Coins, you must email us
                and request that we unfreeze your free virtual Coins. Upon receiving your request and reviewing your
                information, we will unfreeze your free virtual Coins as soon as possible. You agree that we have the
                absolute right to manage, distribute, regulate, control, modify, or eliminate Coins as we deem
                appropriate at our sole discretion, and that we will have no liability for exercising such right. You
                agree that under no circumstances are we liable to you for any damages or claims that might arise from
                the loss or use of your Coins regardless of the circumstances. It is your sole responsibility to manage
                your purchases. If you are under 18 (or younger than the age of legal majority in your place of
                residence), you must obtain the consent of your parent or guardian before making any purchases. Bene
                does not transfer any funds and is not a money-services business. To the extent such functionality is
                available in the Services, it is provided by an unaffiliated third party, and like any other third-party
                service, it is subject to that third party's separate Terms of Service. Bene offers in-app purchases
                ("IAP") through iTunes, Google Play or other application platforms authorized by Bene. If you choose to
                make an IAP, you will be prompted to enter details for your account with your application platform, and
                your application platform account (e.g. iTunes Account) will be charged for the IAP in accordance with
                the terms disclosed to you at the time of purchase as well as the general terms for IAP that apply to
                your application platform account. Some application platforms may charge you sales tax, depending on
                where you live. If you purchase an auto-recurring periodic subscription IAP, your application platform
                account will continue to be billed for the subscription until you cancel the IAP. After your initial
                subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription
                will automatically continue for an additional equivalent period, at the price you agreed to when
                subscribing. If you do not wish your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or
                terminate your subscription, you can do so within the Bene app or log in to your application platform
                account and follow the instructions to cancel your subscription, even if you have otherwise deleted your
                account with us or if you have deleted the Bene application from your device. If you cancel your
                subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your then

                outside the Services without consent. They are granted under a limited license for use within the
                Services only. Coins can't be transferred or resold. If your account is terminated or suspended, or if
                the service is unavailable, all Coins are forfeited. Free or promotional Coins may expire. We're not
                liable for lost Coins due to hacking or your violations. We reserve the right to limit or refuse Coins.
                The price and availability of Coins are at our discretion and can change. If your account is inactive
                for 3 months, free Coins may be frozen but can be unfrozen upon request. We'll refund lost Coins due to
                technical issues if verified. Redemption opportunities are at our discretion. All Coin acquisitions and
                redemptions are final and can't be refunded or returned except at our sole discretion.

                prior notification. This indicates that we might cease providing you with any services, or impose new or
